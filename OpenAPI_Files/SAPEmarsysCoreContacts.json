This can be requested by [raising a support ticket](https://help.emarsys.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012853058-Raising-a-support-request) at our Help Portal.\n\n> **Caution**: The `create_if_not_exists` parameter is designed as a convenience feature to streamline API integrations by eliminating the need for clients to check a contact's existence before updating. When this parameter is enabled, the API will internally verify the contact's existence and, if necessary, create a new contact before proceeding with the update. \n>  Key considerations:\n>   - If the contact already exists, the response will return its existing string ID.\n>   - If the contact does not exist, it will be created automatically, and its assigned ID will follow the response format of the Create Contacts API—meaning it will be an integer.\n\n\n> **Caution**: The `create_if_not_exists` parameter may cause race conditions. Simultaneous or near-simultaneous calls for the same contact identifier can result in conflicts. If you receive a `Contact with the external id already exists` message but no contact is created, please retry the operation.\n\n**Notes:**\n- The maximum payload size is 8 MB, therefore the maximum number of contacts per call depends on the amount of data per contact.\n- The maximum batch size is 1000 contacts per call.\n- Only use the values *1*, *2*, or *null* to update opt-in status. Boolean string literals are not supported. For details, see [Automated double opt-in program](https://help.emarsys.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006090693-Automated-double-opt-in-program) and the [Manage Double Opt-in for Contacts](docs/contact-use-cases/manage-opt-in-for-contacts.md) use case.\n- Updating a contact is an idempotent method, meaning that it can be called multiple times with the same outcome. Note that as a `PUT` request, it replaces all contact information for the contact fields included in the request body (only for the contacts specified in the request), so please make sure that you either: a) include **only** the fields you want to update, or b) populate **all the current field values** and then **add a new value** to the fields that need to be updated.\n- In case you are using the `setEmail` Web Extend command to identify your customers, whenever an update is done by your customers in their email addresses, please make sure to set the `predictUserID` and the `predictSecret` fields to `\"\"` (empty) in the payload. This is done to make sure that a new Predict user ID is created for them as soon as the web behavior field updates take place, usually within 2 hours. Only in this 2-hour period are personalized recommendations not available to view.\n-  When using this endpoint to unsubscribe contacts from an email campaign, also do register the unsubscribe with the [/v3/email/unsubscribe](https://dev.emarsys.com/docs/emarsys-api/b3A6MjQ4OTk4NDU) call. \n- If you want to update a **single-choice field**, use the `choice` identifier that you can find out via [List Available Choices of a Single-choice Field](reference/openapi.json/paths/~1v3~1field~1{fieldID}~1choice~1translate~1{languageId}/get). Do not use `sort_id` to specify a choice or a field. For further details, see our [help portal](https://help.emarsys.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004634689-end-user-guides-creating-custom-fields#field-type-attributes-and-values). \n- Updating **multi-choice fields** is also possible. The following is a simple verification example for this scenario:\n\n``\nPUT     https://api.emarsys.net/api/v3/contact/?create_if_not_exists=1\n``\n```json\n{\n \"3\": \"myemail@gmail.com\",\n \"8765\": [\n    \"foo\",\n    \"bar\",\n    \"baz\",\n    \"qux\"\n  ],\n  \"key_id\": \"3\"\n}\n```\n\nSee [Create Contacts](paths/~1v3~1contact/post) for more information on contact details.\n\n> **Important:** Due to limitations of API specification languages, dynamic keys are not yet supported in query strings on the interactive demo page (**Try it out**). We are working on this issue.<br><br>**Tip:** You can use the [Postman Collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emartech/developer-hub-public-assets/master/resources/Emarsysv3PostmanCollection.json) to test the endpoint.\n\n**Important:** When [Exporting updated contacts](/reference/openapi.json/paths/~1v3~1contact~1getchanges/post), contacts that were updated through this endpoint will only be exported if their email address or opt-in status were updated.",
